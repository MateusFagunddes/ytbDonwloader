# YouTube video downloader

## This terminal app was made in python and it can make: 
- downloads of a single video from YouTube.
- downloads from a .txt file that have YouTube's video links in it.
- downloads from a YouTube playlist. It also can provides infos about the playlist's videos you are about to download. 

### About the code:
- I use 2 external libraries (pytube and colorama) and 2 default libs (time and tqdm)
- The variables names and the inputs are in portuguese (sorry 'bout that). But soon the whole code will be in English.

****IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE CODE, JUST REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE PATHS IN download_video FUNCTION***
